            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Our mission  is to make affordable travel accessible to more people, and to deliver affordable and enjoyable travel experiences that are seamless from end to end. By seamless, we mean hassle-free from the moment you start planning your trip.
            
                To get to our goal, we’ve spent the last 16 years building Abcbooking.com and the Abcbooking app to make searching and booking travel as easy and stress-free as it ought to be
            
                To date, we’ve accrued millions of registered customers, and with a truly global team of more than 4,000 people in 25 markets, we’re considered one of Asia’s leading tech companies.
           
                Wondering if Abcbooking is legit? Then this section’s for you.
                Abcbooking is a trusted and respected brand in Asia and beyond. We’ve spent the last 15 years building our reputation as an easy-to-use, reliable travel-booking platform that makes great-value deals available to millions of people worldwide.
                Our reputation is further backed up by our parent company, Booking Holdings [NASDAQ: BKNG], the umbrella group that also owns Booking.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com, Rentalcars.com, and Opentable.com.
                Abcbooking was acquired by Booking Holdings back in 2007, when it was called The Priceline Group. While people living outside of Asia may not be so familiar with Agoda, they’ve almost certainly heard of Priceline.com, Booking.com, and Kayak.com.
